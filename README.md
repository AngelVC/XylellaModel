# XylellaModel
Project for generating a model for Xylella fastidiosa spread

The aim is to buld a model capable of predicting Xylella fastidiosa spread in time, given an infection entry point and a network reflecting the distribution of host trees (olive tree). We will use data from Joint Research Centre Data Catalogue to train and validate our model.
